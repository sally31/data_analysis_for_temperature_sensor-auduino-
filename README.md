# data_analysis_for_temperature_sensor-auduino-

## description
I made a tempperature sensor with auduino then measured temperature every 1 min for 24 hours then
got temperature data in python and put the data in CSV file every 1 hour so I made 23 CSV(I couldn't get for 
1 hour data as start measuring time issue.)

I analyzed this data for temperature and humidity in jupyter notebook.

the graph are in the code.
