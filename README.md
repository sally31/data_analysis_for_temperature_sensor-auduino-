# data_analysis_for_temperature_sensor-auduino-

## description
I made a tempperature sensor with auduino then measured temperature every 1 min for 24 fours then
got temperature data in python and put the data in CSV file every 1 four so I made 23 CSV(I could'nt got for 
1 hour data as start measuring time issue.)
I analysised this data in jupyter notebook.
